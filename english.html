105 Full of mistakes
Waht was Sandra's present?

Where's Sandra Bob?
I want her.
Do want to speck to her?
Yes I do.
I want her to come to my office.
Tell her to come at once.

Did you want to see me?
Ah, Yes Sandra.
How do you spell 'intelligent'?
Can you tell me?
I-N-T-E-L-L-I-G-E-N-T

That's right.
You've typed it with only one 'L'.
This letter's full of mistakes.
I want you to type it again.
Yes, I'll do that.
I'm sorry about that.

And here's a little present for you.
What is it?
It's a dictionary.
I hope it'll help you.

109 A good idea
what does Jane have with her coffee?

Shall I make some coffee, Jane?
That's good idea, charlotte.
It's readly.
Do you want any milk?
Just a little, please.
What about some sugar?
Two teaspoonfuls?
No less than that.
One and a half teaspoonfuls, please.
That's enough for me.
That was very nice.
Would you like some more?
Yes please.

I'd like cigarette, too,
May I have one.
of course.
I think there are a few in that box.
I'm afraid it's empty.
What a picy!
It doesn't matter.
Have a biscuit instead.
Eat more and smoke less.
That's very good advice.

111 The most expensive model
Can Mr.Frith buy the television on instalment?  
How does it work?

I like this television very much.
How does it cost?

It's the most expensive model 
in the shop.
It costs five hundred pounds.

It's too expensive for us.
We can't afford all that money.

This model's less expensive 
then that one.
It's only three hundred pounds.
But of course,
it's not as good as expensive one.

I don't like this model.
The other model's more expensive,
but it's worth the money.

Can we buy it on instalments?

Of course.
You can pay deposit of thirty pounds,
and then fourteen pounds a month 
for three years.

Do you like it, dear?
I certainly do,
but I don't like the price.
You always want the best,
but we can't afford it.
Sometimes you think 
you are millionaire!

Millionaire don't buy things 
on instalments!
